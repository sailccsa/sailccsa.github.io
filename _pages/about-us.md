CCSA members have been sailing at Creve Coeur Lake for more than 40 years. With between 15 and 20 boats sailing on race day, our primary focus is on racing, improving sailing skills and bringing new sailors into the sport. Unlike other racing clubs, we emphasize having fun and keeping the events relaxed and open to everyone.

Boatyard- Members with boats in the yard are required to come to 2 boatyards per season, but encouraged to come to more. Expect to help with grass cutting, boat moving and other assorted tasks. Refreshments and sea stories provided. Wear protective clothing, boots and gloves recommended. 

Race Dates- Set Up starts at noon, races start at 2pm. No races start after 4pm unless otherwise noted. To qualify for awards sailors must participate in at least 12 races. Using CHIPS High Point Total scoring racers keep their 12 best races, dropping lower scores.
