CCSA members have been sailing at Creve Coeur Lake for more than 40 years. With between 15 and 20 boats sailing on race day, our primary focus is on racing, improving sailing skills and bringing new sailors into the sport. Unlike other racing clubs, we emphasize having fun and keeping the events relaxed and open to everyone.
